        <p>The Long Island Iced Tea was popularized in the 1970s and remains a beloved drink. It’s possible the cocktail was born out of Prohibition, when thirsty scofflaws wanted to disguise their booze. It’s also possible the drink sprung up in the ’70s at a bar in Long Island, or maybe at a TGI Friday’s. This much is known: You still can’t throw a lemon wedge inside the chain restaurant without knocking one over.</p>
