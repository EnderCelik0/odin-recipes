        <h3>Let's get it out of the way: yep, these things looks like little penises. The "wicks" are almonds, too, so guys in 1958 got to imagine what that feels like. Plus, there's mayonnaise on the tip "to look like melted wax"!
        Beyond their obviously phallic nature, you know they turned mushy and brown about halfway through the Christmas party. </h3>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>1 1/2 envelopes ( 1 1/2 tablespoons) unflavored gelatin</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cold water</li>
            <li>2 cups canned cranberry juice cocktail</li>
            <li>4 ripe bananas</li>
            <li>8 salted almonds</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Salad greens</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Soften gelatin in cold water. Heat cranberry cocktail to boiling; add to gelatin and stir to dissolve gelatin. Pour into 8 small, star-shaped molds. Chill until firm; unmold. Cut out and remove a small circle from center of each star the same diameter as the bananas. Peel bananas; cut in halves, crosswise. Insert 1/2 banana in center of each of each star as shown. Top each “cancdle” with a salted almond for a “flame”. Add a little mayonnaise to look like melted wax. Serve on salad greens with mayonnaise. Makes 8 servings.</p>
        <h4>Cherry and Banana Mold</h4>
        <p>Dissolve the contents of 1 package (3 ounces) lemon-flavored gelatin in 1 cup of boiling water; add and stir in 1 cup cold water. Chill gelatin, stirring often, until thick but not set. Fold in 1/2 cup well-drained, halved, canned pitted black cherries and 1 cup sliced ripe banana. Turn into 1-quart mold; chill until firm. Unmold, garnish with salad greens and serve. Makes 4 to servings.</p>
